# Computational-PDE
Assignment codes from my Computational PDE course in TIFR CAM.
Assignment 1 contains Godunov,Lax-Friedrich and Lax-Wendroff for the wave equation,theta-scheme for heat equation and a finite difference scheme for Laplace equation.
Assignment 2 contains Godunov,Lax-Friedrich and Lax-Wendroff scheme for Burger's equation which is from my conservation laws lecture in this course.
